# NFT Benefits

### NFT Staking&#x20;

From the very beginning, the Mutant NFT project is designed to provide passive income opportunities for owners. That’s why the project will offer the opportunity to earn MUT tokens by staking Mutant NFTs.&#x20;

The staking rate will be determined by the length that the NFTs are staked as well as the rarity of the NFT. The longer the staking period and the rarer the NFT, the more MUT tokens can be earned.

When the MUT tokens have been deposited into the owner’s wallet, MUT tokens can be held or immediately transferred into other currencies. They can also be sold on exchanges.

### Collaboration With Other Projects&#x20;

The Mutant project doesn’t want to exist in a bubble. As part of our plan to make the Mutant brand among the most recognizable in the NFT world, we will be seeking out collaboration with other projects, influencers, and brands.&#x20;

As of this time, the project’s team leaders are looking for the best fit for future collaborations. Our mission is to help maximize the brand’s value over the long term.

NFT owners are invited to recommend or offer collaboration opportunities. We seek to create a vibrant and open community where we can all work together to boost brand exposure.&#x20;



### Possible NFT Appreciation&#x20;

The NFT market has seen some incredible valuation increases over the past several years. For instance, the average price of a crypto punk was just $400 in 2018.&#x20;

As late as 2021, Crypto Punks were routinely being sold for well over $1 million dollars. While it is impossible to gauge the future market value of Mutant NFTs, the project’s team members will work to maximize the value of each digital asset.

With that in mind, we have created a robust roadmap that will expand the Mutant NFT brand across various media formats.
