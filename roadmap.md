# Roadmap

Currently, the Mutant team has created a roadmap that will expand the brand over the next 12 months. However, this is just the beginning. It is the goal of the Mutant team to make the project among the most recognizable brands over the next decade.

### Fourth Quarter 2022&#x20;

The Mutant NFT project will launch during the four quarter of 2022. At this time, we will be offering 8,888 unique Mutant NFTs via our official website ([Mutant.one](https://mutants.one/)).&#x20;

During this time, we will also be aggressively marketing the NFT project across multiple social media platforms including Twitter, Telegram, and Reddit.

After the minting is completed, the MUT token will be released. Additionally, we will be launching staking for the NFT. Owners of Mutant NFTs will be able to receive MUT tokens as a staking reward.

### First Quarter 2023

In 2023, we will continue to market the Mutant NFT and MUT tokens across social media platforms. At this time, we will also announce any proposal brought forth by our NFT owners.&#x20;

Additionally, we expect to buy back excess MUT tokens from decentralized exchanges and burn them to ensure deflationary pricing.

We expect the Mutant project to have a vibrant community of owners who will help steer the future of the brand. We will be opening the projects to proposals from owners.

### Second Quarter 2023

We will continue to support the price of the MUT token and the Mutant NFT project through various social media promotions. At this time, we will be looking at various proposals from our Mutant community and deciding which ideas should be explored.&#x20;

It is our mission to help make the Mutant brand one of the more notable projects in 2023.

### Third Quarter 2023&#x20;

We will be releasing our second Mutant NFT collection. The second collection can only be minted with MUT tokens. The project will take all the MUT token proceeds and burn them to help maintain the value of the token and lower the overall circulation count.

### Fourth Quarter 2023&#x20;

We are planning lots of surprises during the fourth quarter of 2023. Our team will provide more specific updates on our telegram group as the holiday season approaches.
