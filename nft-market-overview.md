# NFT Market Overview

NFT sales in 2021 exceed $40 billion dollars. While 2022 has failed to keep up pace with the rapid expansion of the market in 2021, the market is expected to recover in 2023 with total sales exceeding $50 billion dollars. By launching the Mutant NFT project in 2022, there is an opportunity to launch the brand in a quiet market and experience quick brand recognition.&#x20;

As the market recovers in 2023, the Mutant brand may be well established and well positioned to grow.



Today, there are only a few secondary markets for NFTs including Oasis, and others. We expect more first-time NFT buyers to come into the market in 2022 and 2023 which can help accelerate the buy rate of the Mutant NFT.
