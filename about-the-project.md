# About The Project

### Mutant NFTs&#x20;

Mutant NFTs are unique 2D illustrations that have their own special colors, patterns, facial features, and accessories. During the first minting, there will be 8,888 NFTs available.&#x20;

Mutant NFTs will be available for minting on the official Mutants website (Mutant.one) on September 25, 2022. The mint price is 70 wDOGE plus gas fees. Later on, Mutant NFTs will be available on secondary markets.

While all Mutant NFTs are unique some of the NFTs will have qualities that are rarer than others. However, all Mutant NFT holders will have the ability to provide their input into the project.&#x20;

In the future, the project may provide airdrops and other opportunities for Mutant NFT holders.

### **NFT Artwork**

Mutants are designed to be completely unique in the NFT world. Forgoing the traditional animal paradigm of dogs, cats, and apes, Mutants are mystical chicken-like creatures that have never been seen before in the NFT world. Each Mutant is designed with unique attributes and two NFT are like.

All designs and attributes have been professionally illustrated to attract serious NFT collectors. Also, each design is ideal for use for profile pics, merchandise, and other commercial use.&#x20;

The Mutants project team is seeking to make the NFT’s mythical creatures the next “must have '' in the digital collector world.

### Project Token

The Mutant NFT project will also include its own token known as MUTs. These tokens will be available on various decentralized exchanges and will offer staking opportunities for holders.&#x20;

Additionally, the Mutant NFT project will be buying back MUT tokens from exchanges to help maintain a stable floor on the price.

Mutant NFT owners will be able to stake their NFTs and earn MUT tokens. In a later section, we will go into more detail about this passive income earning opportunity.

### **Blockchain**

The Mutant NFT project is built on the Dogecoin blockchain. This ensures that gas fees stay low and that transactions of the MUT token are speedy and inexpensive.&#x20;

The Mutant team carefully researches all major blockchains and has come to the conclusion that the Dogecoin blockchain offers the ideal combination of efficiency and affordability.

Additionally, the Mutant project team will perform regular audits of the MUT token to ensure the integrity of all stakeholders. Regular audit reports will be available on the Mutant project website ([Mutant.one](https://mutants.one/))

### Mutant Scarcity

One of the most attractive aspects of an NFT project is the scarcity of certain character attributes. The Mutant NFT project offers a total of 8,888 unique pieces of digital artwork.&#x20;

Some of these art pieces feature rare attributes which will likely carry a higher value than the average price of a Mutant.

To ensure the integrity of the minting process, all Mutant NFTs will be distributed completely at random. Therefore, anyone who pays the 70 wDOGE NFT plus the gas fee will have an equal opportunity to own a rare Mutant.&#x20;
