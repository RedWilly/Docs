# Executive Summary

The Mutant NFT project will consist of 8,888 randomly generated completely unique 2-D NFTs. The mint date of the project is on September 6, 2022, at a mint price of 70 DOGE plus gas fee.&#x20;



The project is designed to provide passive income opportunities for holders of the Mutant NFTs. Mutants will have varying levels of rarity which may factor into their value and their possible income earning opportunities.



The Mutant NFT roadmap includes aggressive marketing plans to help promote the project across multiple social media channels. During the fourth quarter of 2022 and the first quarter 2023, the Mutant project will be promoted on Twitter, Instagram, Discord, and other platforms. This may also include giveaways to help add interest in the project.



Income opportunities include the ability to earn Mutant tokens by staking Mutant NFTs. The staking opportunity is expected to launch during the second quarter of 2023. By the end of 2023, the project will begin to purchase Mutant tokens from decentralized exchanges to help maintain the floor price of the token.



All Mutant NFT holders will have the opportunity to steer the direction of the project. That includes proposing new income-generating opportunities, products, services, promotions, and merchandising.
