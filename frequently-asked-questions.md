# Frequently Asked Questions

### What makes the Mutant NFT project unique?

The Mutant NFT project stands out due to its commitment to create 8,888 complete unique NFTs which will offer passive income staking opportunities on the Dogecoin blockchain.&#x20;

Also, the NFT project will have an affordable initial mint price in order to drive a high ownership level.

Additionally, the project will launch its own token - MUT - after the initial launch of the NFT collection. Owners will be able to stake Mutant NFTs and receive MUT tokens.&#x20;

These tokens will be later made available on various decentralized exchanges. Finally, the project welcomes input from both NFT and token holders to help steer the future of the project.

### What is the minting information?

Mutant NFTs will begin their initial minting on September 30, 2022, at 12:00 PM Eastern Standard Time on the project’s official website ([mutants.one](https://mutants.one/)). The current minting price of 70 wDoge.&#x20;

There is currently no limit to how many Mutants can be minted by an individual wallet. After the initial minting, owners will have the opportunity to stake their NFTs and receive MUT tokens.

### Are there more meetings planned for the future?

The Mutant project team will carefully monitor the NFT market and detect the opportune time to launch additional collections. However, the team will be careful to limit the number of NFTs on the market in order to maintain the floor price of the original collection.&#x20;

Any updates will be announced on the project’s social media accounts.

### What is the Mutant token?

The mutant token is the official currency of the project. The token will take the symbol MUT and will be available on decentralized trading markets soon after its launch.&#x20;

Those who want immediate access to MUT tokens can stake their Mutant NFTs and receive MUTA tokens as passive income.

### How does NFT rarity affect its value?

Each one of the 8,888 Mutant NFTs has completely unique attribute sets. Some of these attributes are rarer than others. The rarer the attributes, the more valued the NFT. Owners who stake rare NFTs will be able to receive a higher rate of return.&#x20;

Note that any future collections will not offer the same rare attributes in order to maintain the value of the original collection.
